# Lukas Swenson's Portolio Page (Code Louisville Final Project)

This portfolio consists of a responsive single-page layout that focuses on my educational background and work experience. It's purpose is to function as capstone project for the Code Louisville program as well as the start of a professional portfolio page. The page is navigable via a menu at the top that is linked to anchor tags further down the site. The contact form at the bottom has fields for a name, email, and short message.

# CSS Feature: 
<ul>
<li>The navigation menu in the upper right corner expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon.</li>
</ul>

# JavaScript Features: 
<ul>
<li>The contact form at the bottom of the page validates the name input by checking if a value is present. It also validates the email using a regex input validator. If both the name field and email field are filled in, it displays a thank you message with the user's name.</li>
<li>Clicking the hamburger menu icon in mobile and tablet view shows a hidden menu. Clicking the "x" closes the menu. Making a selection on (e.g. "My Experience") closes the menu. </li>
</ul>
